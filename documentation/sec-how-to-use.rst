How to use the script
=====================

``latexindent.pl`` ships as part of the TeXLive distribution for Linux and Mac users; ``latexindent.exe`` ships as part of the TeXLive for Windows users. These files are also available from github (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.) should you wish to use them without a TeX distribution; in this case, you may like to read :numref:`sec:updating-path` which details how the ``path`` variable can be updated.

.. index:: TeXLive

In what follows, we will always refer to ``latexindent.pl``, but depending on your operating system and preference, you might substitute ``latexindent.exe`` or simply ``latexindent``.

There are two ways to use ``latexindent.pl``: from the command line, and using ``arara``; we discuss these in :numref:`sec:commandline` and :numref:`sec:arara` respectively. We will discuss how to change the settings and behaviour of the script in :numref:`sec:defuseloc`.

.. _sec:commandline:

From the command line
---------------------

``latexindent.pl`` has a number of different switches/flags/options, which can be combined in any way that you like, either in short or long form as detailed below. ``latexindent.pl`` produces a ``.log`` file, ``indent.log``, every time it is run; the name of the log file can be customised, but we will refer to the log file as ``indent.log`` throughout this document. There is a base of information that is written to ``indent.log``, but other additional information will be written depending on
which of the following options are used.

When using ``latexindent.pl`` in different ways on different systems, the range of characters supported by its switches/flags/options may vary. We discuss these in Section :numref:`app:encoding`.

.. describe:: -v, –version

.. index:: switches;-v, –version definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -v
   latexindent.pl --version

This will output only the version number to the terminal.

.. describe:: -vv, –vversion

.. index:: switches;-vv, –vversion definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -vv
   latexindent.pl --vversion

This will output *verbose* version details to the terminal, including the location of ``latexindent.pl`` and ``defaultSettings.yaml``.

.. describe:: -h, –help

.. index:: switches;-h, –help definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -h
   latexindent.pl --help

As above this will output a welcome message to the terminal, including the version number and available options.

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex

This will operate on ``myfile.tex``, but will simply output to your terminal; ``myfile.tex`` will not be changed by ``latexindent.pl`` in any way using this command.

You can instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to operate on multiple (batches) of files, for example

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile1.tex myfile2.tex

Full details are given in :numref:`sec:batches`.

.. describe:: -w, –overwrite

.. index:: switches;-w, –overwrite definition and details

.. index:: backup files;overwrite switch, -w

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -w myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl --overwrite myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex --overwrite 

This *will* overwrite ``myfile.tex``, but it will make a copy of ``myfile.tex`` first. You can control the name of the extension (default is ``.bak``), and how many different backups are made – more on this in :numref:`sec:defuseloc`, and in particular see ``backupExtension`` and ``onlyOneBackUp``.

Note that if ``latexindent.pl`` can not create the backup, then it will exit without touching your original file; an error message will be given asking you to check the permissions of the backup file.

.. describe:: -wd, –overwriteIfDifferent

.. index:: switches;-wd, –overwriteIfDifferent definition and details

.. index:: backup files;overwriteIfDifferent switch, -wd

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -wd myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl --overwriteIfDifferent myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex --overwriteIfDifferent

This *will* overwrite ``myfile.tex`` but only *if the indented text is different from the original*. If the indented text is *not* different from the original, then ``myfile.tex`` will *not* be overwritten.

All other details from the ``-w`` switch are relevant here. If you call ``latexindent.pl`` with both the ``-wd`` and the ``-w`` switch, then the ``-w`` switch will be deactivated and the ``-wd`` switch takes priority.

.. describe:: -o=output.tex,–outputfile=output.tex

.. index:: switches;-o, –output definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -o=output.tex myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=output.tex 
   latexindent.pl --outputfile=output.tex myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl --outputfile output.tex myfile.tex

This will indent ``myfile.tex`` and output it to ``output.tex``, overwriting it (``output.tex``) if it already exists [1]_.

Note that if ``latexindent.pl`` is called with both the ``-w`` and ``-o`` switches, then ``-w`` will be ignored and ``-o`` will take priority (this seems safer than the other way round). The same is true for the ``-wd`` switch, and the ``-o`` switch takes priority over it.

Note that using ``-o`` as above is equivalent to using

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex > output.tex

You can call the ``-o`` switch with the name of the output file *without* an extension; in this case, ``latexindent.pl`` will use the extension from the original file. For example, the following two calls to ``latexindent.pl`` are equivalent:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=output
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=output.tex

You can call the ``-o`` switch using a ``+`` symbol at the beginning; this will concatenate the name of the input file and the text given to the ``-o`` switch. For example, the following two calls to ``latexindent.pl`` are equivalent:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=+new
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=myfilenew.tex

You can call the ``-o`` switch using a ``++`` symbol at the end of the name of your output file; this tells ``latexindent.pl`` to search successively for the name of your output file concatenated with :math:`0, 1, \ldots` while the name of the output file exists. For example,

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=output++

tells ``latexindent.pl`` to output to ``output0.tex``, but if it exists then output to ``output1.tex``, and so on.

Calling ``latexindent.pl`` with simply

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=++

tells it to output to ``myfile0.tex``, but if it exists then output to ``myfile1.tex`` and so on.

The ``+`` and ``++`` feature of the ``-o`` switch can be combined; for example, calling

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=+out++

tells ``latexindent.pl`` to output to ``myfileout0.tex``, but if it exists, then try ``myfileout1.tex``, and so on.

There is no need to specify a file extension when using the ``++`` feature, but if you wish to, then you should include it *after* the ``++`` symbols, for example

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=+out++.tex

See :numref:`app:differences` for details of how the interface has changed from Version 2.2 to Version 3.0 for this flag. .. describe:: -s, –silent

.. index:: switches;-s, –silent definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -s myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -s

Silent mode: no output will be given to the terminal.

.. describe:: -t, –trace

.. index:: switches;-t, –trace definition and details

.. label follows

.. _page:traceswitch:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -t myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -t

Tracing mode: verbose output will be given to ``indent.log``. This is useful if ``latexindent.pl`` has made a mistake and you’re trying to find out where and why. You might also be interested in learning about ``latexindent.pl``\ ’s thought process – if so, this switch is for you, although it should be noted that, especially for large files, this does affect performance of the script.

.. describe:: -tt, –ttrace

.. index:: switches;-tt, –ttrace definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -tt myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -tt

*More detailed* tracing mode: this option gives more details to ``indent.log`` than the standard ``trace`` option (note that, even more so than with ``-t``, especially for large files, performance of the script will be affected).

.. describe:: -l, –local[=myyaml.yaml,other.yaml,...]

.. index:: switches;-l, –local definition and details

.. label follows

.. _page:localswitch:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l=myyaml.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l myyaml.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l first.yaml,second.yaml,third.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l=first.yaml,second.yaml,third.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -l=first.yaml,second.yaml,third.yaml 

``latexindent.pl`` will always load ``defaultSettings.yaml`` (rhymes with camel) and if it is called with the ``-l`` switch and it finds ``localSettings.yaml`` in the same directory as ``myfile.tex``, then, if not found, it looks for ``localSettings.yaml`` (and friends, see :numref:`sec:localsettings`) in the current working directory, then these settings will be added to the indentation scheme. Information will be given in ``indent.log`` on the success or failure of loading
``localSettings.yaml``.

The ``-l`` flag can take an *optional* parameter which details the name (or names separated by commas) of a YAML file(s) that resides in the same directory as ``myfile.tex``; you can use this option if you would like to load a settings file in the current working directory that is *not* called ``localSettings.yaml``. In fact, you can specify both *relative* and *absolute paths* for your YAML files; for example

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l=../../myyaml.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l=/home/cmhughes/Desktop/myyaml.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l=C:\Users\cmhughes\Desktop\myyaml.yaml myfile.tex

You will find a lot of other explicit demonstrations of how to use the ``-l`` switch throughout this documentation,

You can call the ``-l`` switch with a ‘+’ symbol either before or after another YAML file; for example:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l=+myyaml.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l "+ myyaml.yaml" myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l=myyaml.yaml+  myfile.tex

which translate, respectively, to

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l=localSettings.yaml,myyaml.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l=localSettings.yaml,myyaml.yaml myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -l=myyaml.yaml,localSettings.yaml myfile.tex

Note that the following is *not* allowed:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l+myyaml.yaml myfile.tex

and

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l + myyaml.yaml myfile.tex

will *only* load ``localSettings.yaml``, and ``myyaml.yaml`` will be ignored. If you wish to use spaces between any of the YAML settings, then you must wrap the entire list of YAML files in quotes, as demonstrated above.

You may also choose to omit the ``yaml`` extension, such as

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l=localSettings,myyaml myfile.tex

.. describe:: -y, –yaml=yaml settings

.. index:: switches;-y, –yaml definition and details

.. index:: indentation;default

.. index:: indentation;defaultIndent using -y switch

.. label follows

.. _page:yamlswitch:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -y="defaultIndent: ' '"
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -y="defaultIndent: ' ',maximumIndentation:' '"
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -y="indentRules: one: '\t\t\t\t'"
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -y='modifyLineBreaks:environments:EndStartsOnOwnLine:3' -m
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -y='modifyLineBreaks:environments:one:EndStartsOnOwnLine:3' -m

You can specify YAML settings from the command line using the ``-y`` or ``–yaml`` switch; sample demonstrations are given above. Note, in particular, that multiple settings can be specified by separating them via commas. There is a further option to use a ``;`` to separate fields, which is demonstrated in :numref:`sec:yamlswitch`.

Any settings specified via this switch will be loaded *after* any specified using the ``-l`` switch. This is discussed further in :numref:`sec:loadorder`. .. describe:: -d, –onlydefault

.. index:: switches;-d, –onlydefault definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -d myfile.tex

Only ``defaultSettings.yaml``: you might like to read :numref:`sec:defuseloc` before using this switch. By default, ``latexindent.pl`` will always search for ``indentconfig.yaml`` or ``.indentconfig.yaml`` in your home directory. If you would prefer it not to do so then (instead of deleting or renaming ``indentconfig.yaml`` or ``.indentconfig.yaml``) you can simply call the script with the ``-d`` switch; note that this will also tell the script to ignore ``localSettings.yaml`` even if it has
been called with the ``-l`` switch; ``latexindent.pl`` will also ignore any settings specified from the ``-y`` switch.

.. describe:: -c, –cruft=<directory>

.. index:: switches;-c, –cruft definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -c=/path/to/directory/ myfile.tex

If you wish to have backup files and ``indent.log`` written to a directory other than the current working directory, then you can send these ‘cruft’ files to another directory. Note the use of a trailing forward slash.

If the cruft directory does not exist, ``latexindent.pl`` will attempt to create it.

.. describe:: -g, –logfile=<name of log file>

.. index:: switches;-g, –logfile definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -g=other.log myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -g other.log myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl --logfile other.log myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -g other.log 

By default, ``latexindent.pl`` reports information to ``indent.log``, but if you wish to change the name of this file, simply call the script with your chosen name after the ``-g`` switch as demonstrated above.

If ``latexindent.pl`` can not open the log file that you specify, then the script will operate, and no log file will be produced; this might be helpful to users who wish to specify the following, for example

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -g /dev/null myfile.tex

.. describe:: -sl, –screenlog

.. index:: switches;-sl, –screenlog definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -sl myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -screenlog myfile.tex

Using this option tells ``latexindent.pl`` to output the log file to the screen, as well as to your chosen log file.

.. describe:: -m, –modifylinebreaks

.. index:: switches;-m, –modifylinebreaks definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -m myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -modifylinebreaks myfile.tex

One of the most exciting developments in Version 3.0 is the ability to modify line breaks; for full details see :numref:`sec:modifylinebreaks`

``latexindent.pl`` can also be called on a file without the file extension, for example

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile

and in which case, you can specify the order in which extensions are searched for; see :numref:`lst:fileExtensionPreference` for full details. .. describe:: STDIN

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   cat myfile.tex | latexindent.pl
   cat myfile.tex | latexindent.pl -

``latexindent.pl`` will allow input from STDIN, which means that you can pipe output from other commands directly into the script. For example assuming that you have content in ``myfile.tex``, then the above command will output the results of operating upon ``myfile.tex``.

If you wish to use this feature with your own local settings, via the ``-l`` switch, then you should finish your call to ``latexindent.pl`` with a ``-`` sign:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   cat myfile.tex | latexindent.pl -l=mysettings.yaml -

Similarly, if you simply type ``latexindent.pl`` at the command line, then it will expect (STDIN) input from the command line.

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl

Once you have finished typing your input, you can press

-  ``CTRL+D`` on Linux

-  ``CTRL+Z`` followed by ``ENTER`` on Windows

to signify that your input has finished. Thanks to ((xu-cheng) 2018) for an update to this feature. .. describe:: -r, –replacement

.. index:: switches;-r, –replacement definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -r myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -replacement myfile.tex

You can call ``latexindent.pl`` with the ``-r`` switch to instruct it to perform replacements/substitutions on your file; full details and examples are given in :numref:`sec:replacements`.

.. index:: verbatim;rv, replacementrespectverb switch

.. describe:: -rv, –replacementrespectverb

.. index:: switches;-rv, –replacementrespectverb definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -rv myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -replacementrespectverb myfile.tex

You can instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to perform replacements/substitutions by using the ``-rv`` switch, but will *respect verbatim code blocks*; full details and examples are given in :numref:`sec:replacements`.

.. describe:: -rr, –onlyreplacement

.. index:: switches;-rr, –onlyreplacement definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -rr myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -onlyreplacement myfile.tex

You can instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to skip all of its other indentation operations and *only* perform replacements/substitutions by using the ``-rr`` switch; full details and examples are given in :numref:`sec:replacements`.

.. describe:: -k, –check

.. index:: switches;-k, –check definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -k myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -check myfile.tex

You can instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to check if the text after indentation matches that given in the original file.

The ``exit`` code

.. index:: exit code

of ``latexindent.pl`` is 0 by default. If you use the ``-k`` switch then

-  if the text after indentation matches that given in the original file, then the exit code is 0;

-  if the text after indentation does *not* match that given in the original file, then the exit code is 1.

The value of the exit code may be important to those wishing to, for example, check the status of the indentation in continuous integration tools such as GitHub Actions. Full details of the exit codes of ``latexindent.pl`` are given in :numref:`tab:exit-codes`.

A simple ``diff`` will be given in ``indent.log``.

.. describe:: -kv, –checkv

.. index:: switches;-kv, –checkv definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -kv myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -checkv myfile.tex

The ``check verbose`` switch is exactly the same as the ``-k`` switch, except that it is *verbose*, and it will output the (simple) diff to the terminal, as well as to ``indent.log``.

.. describe:: -n, –lines=MIN-MAX

.. index:: switches;-n, –lines definition and details

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -n 5-8 myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -lines 5-8 myfile.tex

The ``lines`` switch instructs ``latexindent.pl`` to operate only on specific line ranges within ``myfile.tex``.

Complete demonstrations are given in :numref:`sec:line-switch`.

.. describe:: –GCString

.. index:: switches;–GCString

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl --GCString myfile.tex

instructs ``latexindent.pl`` to load the ``Unicode::GCString`` module. This should only be necessary if you find that the alignment at ampersand routine (described in :numref:`subsec:align-at-delimiters`) does not work for your language. Further details are given in :numref:`subsec:the-GCString`.

.. label follows

.. _sec:arara:

From arara
----------

Using ``latexindent.pl`` from the command line is fine for some folks, but others may find it easier to use from ``arara``; you can find the arara rule for ``latexindent.pl`` and its associated documentation at (Cereda 2013).

Summary of exit codes
---------------------

.. index:: exit code;summary

Assuming that you call ``latexindent.pl`` on ``myfile.tex``

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile.tex

then ``latexindent.pl`` can exit with the exit codes given in :numref:`tab:exit-codes`.
