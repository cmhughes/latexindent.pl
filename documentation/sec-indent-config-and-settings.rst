indentconfig.yaml, local settings and the -y switch 
===================================================

The behaviour of ``latexindent.pl`` is controlled from the settings specified in any of the YAML files that you tell it to load. By default, ``latexindent.pl`` will only load ``defaultSettings.yaml``, but there are a few ways that you can tell it to load your own settings files.

We focus our discussion on ``indentconfig.yaml``, but there are other options which are detailed in :numref:`app:indentconfig:options`.

.. label follows

.. _subsec:indentconfig:

indentconfig.yaml and .indentconfig.yaml
----------------------------------------

``latexindent.pl`` will always check your home directory for ``indentconfig.yaml`` and ``.indentconfig.yaml`` (unless it is called with the ``-d`` switch), which is a plain text file you can create that contains the *absolute* paths for any settings files that you wish ``latexindent.pl`` to load. There is no difference between ``indentconfig.yaml`` and ``.indentconfig.yaml``, other than the fact that ``.indentconfig.yaml`` is a ‘hidden’ file; thank you to (Diaz 2014) for providing this feature.
In what follows, we will use ``indentconfig.yaml``, but it is understood that this could equally represent ``.indentconfig.yaml``. If you have both files in existence then ``indentconfig.yaml`` takes priority.

For Mac and Linux users, their home directory is `` /username`` while Windows (Vista onwards) is ``C:\Users\username``\  [1]_ :numref:`lst:indentconfig` shows a sample ``indentconfig.yaml`` file.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/indent-config.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``indentconfig.yaml`` (sample) 
	:name: lst:indentconfig

Note that the ``.yaml`` files you specify in ``indentconfig.yaml`` will be loaded in the order in which you write them. Each file doesn’t have to have every switch from ``defaultSettings.yaml``; in fact, I recommend that you only keep the switches that you want to *change* in these settings files.

To get started with your own settings file, you might like to save a copy of ``defaultSettings.yaml`` in another directory and call it, for example, ``mysettings.yaml``. Once you have added the path to ``indentconfig.yaml`` you can change the switches and add more code-block names to it as you see fit – have a look at :numref:`lst:mysettings` for an example that uses four tabs for the default indent, adds the ``tabbing`` environment/command to the list of environments that contains alignment
delimiters; you might also like to refer to the many YAML files detailed throughout the rest of this documentation.

.. index:: indentation;defaultIndent using YAML file

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/tabbing.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``mysettings.yaml`` (example) 
	:name: lst:mysettings

You can make sure that your settings are loaded by checking ``indent.log`` for details – if you have specified a path that ``latexindent.pl`` doesn’t recognise then you’ll get a warning, otherwise you’ll get confirmation that ``latexindent.pl`` has read your settings file. [2]_

.. index:: warning;editing YAML files

.. warning::	
	
	When editing ``.yaml`` files it is *extremely* important to remember how sensitive they are to spaces. I highly recommend copying and pasting from ``defaultSettings.yaml`` when you create your first ``whatevernameyoulike.yaml`` file.
	
	If ``latexindent.pl`` can not read your ``.yaml`` file it will tell you so in ``indent.log``.


As of you can specify the ``paths`` field from :numref:`lst:indentconfig` within any of your ``latexindent.yaml`` and friends settings files. This can lead to creative nesting of configuration files; a demonstration is given in :numref:`sec:appendix:paths`.

.. label follows

.. _sec:localsettings:

localSettings.yaml and friends
------------------------------

The ``-l`` switch tells ``latexindent.pl`` to look for ``localSettings.yaml`` and/or friends in the *same directory* as ``myfile.tex``. For example, if you use the following command

.. index:: switches;-l demonstration

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l myfile.tex

then ``latexindent.pl`` will search for and then, assuming they exist, load each of the following files in the following order:

#. localSettings.yaml

#. latexindent.yaml

#. .localSettings.yaml

#. .latexindent.yaml

These files will be assumed to be in the same directory as ``myfile.tex``, or otherwise in the current working directory. You do not need to have all of the above files, usually just one will be sufficient. In what follows, whenever we refer to ``localSettings.yaml`` it is assumed that it can mean any of the four named options listed above.

If you’d prefer to name your ``localSettings.yaml`` file something different, (say, ``mysettings.yaml`` as in :numref:`lst:mysettings`) then you can call ``latexindent.pl`` using, for example,

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l=mysettings.yaml myfile.tex

Any settings file(s) specified using the ``-l`` switch will be read *after* ``defaultSettings.yaml`` and, assuming they exist, any user setting files specified in ``indentconfig.yaml``.

Your settings file can contain any switches that you’d like to change; a sample is shown in :numref:`lst:localSettings`, and you’ll find plenty of further examples throughout this manual.

.. index:: verbatim;verbatimEnvironments demonstration (-l switch)

.. code-block:: latex
   :caption: ``localSettings.yaml`` (example) 
   :name: lst:localSettings

   #  verbatim environments - environments specified
   #  here will not be changed at all!
   verbatimEnvironments:
       cmhenvironment: 0
       myenv: 1

You can make sure that your settings file has been loaded by checking ``indent.log`` for details; if it can not be read then you receive a warning, otherwise you’ll get confirmation that ``latexindent.pl`` has read your settings file.

.. label follows

.. _sec:yamlswitch:

The -y|yaml switch
------------------

You may use the ``-y`` switch to load your settings; for example, if you wished to specify the settings from :numref:`lst:localSettings` using the ``-y`` switch, then you could use the following command:

.. index:: verbatim;verbatimEnvironments demonstration (-y switch)

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0;myenv:1" myfile.tex

Note the use of ``;`` to specify another field within ``verbatimEnvironments``. This is shorthand, and equivalent, to using the following command:

.. index:: switches;-y demonstration

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0,verbatimEnvironments:myenv:1" myfile.tex

You may, of course, specify settings using the ``-y`` switch as well as, for example, settings loaded using the ``-l`` switch; for example,

.. index:: switches;-l demonstration

.. index:: switches;-y demonstration

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -l=mysettings.yaml -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0;myenv:1" myfile.tex

Any settings specified using the ``-y`` switch will be loaded *after* any specified using ``indentconfig.yaml`` and the ``-l`` switch.

If you wish to specify any regex-based settings using the ``-y`` switch,

.. index:: regular expressions;using -y switch

it is important not to use quotes surrounding the regex; for example, with reference to the ‘one sentence per line’ feature (:numref:`sec:onesentenceperline`) and the listings within :numref:`lst:sentencesEndWith`, the following settings give the option to have sentences end with a semicolon

.. index:: switches;-y demonstration

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -m --yaml='modifyLineBreaks:oneSentencePerLine:sentencesEndWith:other:\;'

Note that the ``paths`` settings (see :numref:`sec:appendix:paths`) can *not* be specified using the ``-y`` switch.

.. label follows

.. _sec:loadorder:

Settings load order
-------------------

``latexindent.pl`` loads the settings files in the following order:

.. index:: switches;-l in relation to other settings

#. ``defaultSettings.yaml`` is always loaded, and can not be renamed;

#. ``anyUserSettings.yaml`` and any other arbitrarily-named files specified in ``indentconfig.yaml``;

#. ``localSettings.yaml`` but only if found in the same directory as ``myfile.tex`` and called with ``-l`` switch; this file can be renamed, provided that the call to ``latexindent.pl`` is adjusted accordingly (see :numref:`sec:localsettings`). You may specify both relative and absolute paths to other YAML files using the ``-l`` switch, separating multiple files using commas;

#. any settings specified in the ``-y`` switch.

A visual representation of this is given in :numref:`fig:loadorder`.

.. label follows

.. _fig:loadorder:

.. figure:: figure-schematic.png
   

   Schematic of the load order described in :numref:`sec:loadorder`; solid lines represent mandatory files, dotted lines represent optional files. ``indentconfig.yaml`` can contain as many files as you like. The files will be loaded in order; if you specify settings for the same field in more than one file, the most recent takes priority.

   If you’re not sure where to put ``indentconfig.yaml``, don’t worry ``latexindent.pl`` will tell you in the log file exactly where to put it assuming it doesn’t exist already.
