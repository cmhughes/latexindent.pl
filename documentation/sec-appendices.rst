.. _sec:requiredmodules:

Required Perl modules
---------------------

If you intend to use ``latexindent.pl`` and *not* one of the supplied standalone executable files (``latexindent.exe`` is available for Windows users without Perl, see :numref:`subsubsec:latexindent:exe`), then you will need a few standard Perl modules.

If you can run the minimum code in :numref:`lst:helloworld` as in

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   perl helloworld.pl

then you will be able to run ``latexindent.pl``, otherwise you may need to install the missing modules; see :numref:`sec:module-installer` and :numref:`sec:manual-module-instal`.

.. code-block:: latex
   :caption: ``helloworld.pl`` 
   :name: lst:helloworld

   #!/usr/bin/perl

   use strict;                         #     |
   use warnings;                       #     |
   use Encode;                         #     |
   use Getopt::Long;                   #     |
   use Data::Dumper;                   #  these modules are
   use List::Util qw(max);             #  generally part
   use PerlIO::encoding;               #  of a default perl distribution
   use open ':std', ':encoding(UTF-8)';#     |
   use Text::Wrap;                     #     |
   use Text::Tabs;                     #     |
   use FindBin;                        #     |
   use File::Copy;                     #     |
   use File::Basename;                 #     |
   use File::Path;                     #     |
   use File::HomeDir;                  # <--- typically requires install via cpanm
   use YAML::Tiny;                     # <--- typically requires install via cpanm

   print "hello world";
   exit;

.. _sec:module-installer:

Module installer script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``latexindent.pl`` ships with a helper script that will install any missing ``perl`` modules on your system; if you run

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   perl latexindent-module-installer.pl

or

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   perl latexindent-module-installer.pl

then, once you have answered ``Y``, the appropriate modules will be installed onto your distribution.

.. label follows

.. _sec:manual-module-instal:

Manually installing modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manually installing the modules given in :numref:`lst:helloworld` will vary depending on your operating system and ``Perl`` distribution.

Linux
~~~~~

perlbrew
^^^^^^^^

Linux users may be interested in exploring Perlbrew (“Perlbrew” n.d.); an example installation would be:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo apt-get install perlbrew
   perlbrew init
   perlbrew install perl-5.40.0
   perlbrew switch perl-5.40.0
   sudo apt-get install curl
   curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
   cpanm YAML::Tiny
   cpanm File::HomeDir

.. index:: cpan

Ubuntu/Debian
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For other distributions, the Ubuntu/Debian approach may work as follows

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo apt install perl
   sudo cpan -i App::cpanminus
   sudo cpanm YAML::Tiny
   sudo cpanm File::HomeDir

or else by running, for example,

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo perl -MCPAN -e'install "File::HomeDir"'

Ubuntu: using the texlive from apt-get
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ubuntu users that install texlive using ``apt-get`` as in the following

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo apt install texlive
   sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended

may need the following additional command to work with ``latexindent.pl``

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo apt install texlive-extra-utils

Ubuntu: users without perl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``latexindent-linux`` is a standalone executable for Ubuntu Linux (and therefore does not require a Perl distribution) and caches copies of the Perl modules onto your system. It is available from (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.).

.. index:: latexindent-linux

.. index:: linux

.. index:: TeXLive

Arch-based distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``latexindent`` is included in Arch-packaged TeX Live, and can be installed by:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo pacman -S texlive-binextra perl-yaml-tiny perl-file-homedir

To enable optional ``–GCString`` switch, install ``perl-unicode-linebreak``:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo pacman -S perl-unicode-linebreak

Alpine
^^^^^^

If you are using Alpine, some ``Perl`` modules are not build-compatible with Alpine, but replacements are available through ``apk``. For example, you might use the commands given in :numref:`lst:alpine-install`; thanks to (J. 2020) for providing these details.

.. code-block:: latex
   :caption: ``alpine-install.sh`` 
   :name: lst:alpine-install

   # Installing perl
   apk --no-cache add miniperl perl-utils

   # Installing incompatible latexindent perl dependencies via apk
   apk --no-cache add \
       perl-log-dispatch \
       perl-namespace-autoclean \
       perl-specio \
       perl-unicode-linebreak

   # Installing remaining latexindent perl dependencies via cpan
   apk --no-cache add curl wget make
   ls /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent
   cd /usr/local/bin && \
       curl -L https://cpanmin.us/ -o cpanm && \
       chmod +x cpanm
   cpanm -n App::cpanminus
   cpanm -n File::HomeDir
   cpanm -n Params::ValidationCompiler
   cpanm -n YAML::Tiny

Users of NixOS might like to see https://github.com/cmhughes/latexindent.pl/issues/222 for tips.

Mac
~~~

Users of the Macintosh operating system might like to explore the following commands, for example:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   brew install perl
   brew install cpanm

   cpanm YAML::Tiny
   cpanm File::HomeDir

Alternatively,

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   brew install latexindent

``latexindent-macos`` is a standalone executable for macOS (and therefore does not require a Perl distribution) and caches copies of the Perl modules onto your system. It is available from (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.).

.. index:: latexindent-macos

.. index:: macOS

.. index:: TeXLive

Windows
~~~~~~~

Strawberry Perl users on Windows might use ``CPAN client``. All of the modules are readily available on CPAN (“CPAN: Comprehensive Perl Archive Network” n.d.). ``indent.log`` will contain details of the location of the Perl modules on your system.

``latexindent.exe`` is a standalone executable for Windows (and therefore does not require a Perl distribution) and caches copies of the Perl modules onto your system; if you wish to see where they are cached, use the ``trace`` option, e.g

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.exe -t myfile.tex

.. label follows

.. _subsec:the-GCString:

The GCString switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you find that the ``lookForAlignDelims`` (as in :numref:`subsec:align-at-delimiters`) does not work correctly for your language, then you may wish to use the ``Unicode::GCString`` module .

.. index:: perl;Unicode GCString module

.. index:: switches;–GCString demonstration

This can be loaded by calling ``latexindent.pl`` with the ``GCString`` switch as in

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl --GCString myfile.tex

In this case, you will need to have the ``Unicode::GCString`` installed in your ``perl`` distribution by using, for example,

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   cpanm Unicode::GCString

Note: this switch does *nothing* for ``latexindent.exe`` which loads the module by default. Users of ``latexindent.exe`` should not see any difference in behaviour whether they use this switch or not, as ``latexindent.exe`` loads the ``Unicode::GCString`` module.

.. label follows

.. _sec:updating-path:

Updating the path variable
--------------------------

``latexindent.pl`` has a few scripts (available at (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.)) that can update the ``path`` variables. Thank you to (Juang 2015) for this feature. If you’re on a Linux or Mac machine, then you’ll want ``CMakeLists.txt`` from (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.).

Add to path for Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add ``latexindent.pl`` to the path for Linux, follow these steps:

#. download ``latexindent.pl`` and its associated modules, ``defaultSettings.yaml``, to your chosen directory from (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.) ;

#. within your directory, create a directory called ``path-helper-files`` and download ``CMakeLists.txt`` and ``cmake_uninstall.cmake.in`` from (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.)/path-helper-files to this directory;

#. run

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      ls /usr/local/bin

   to see what is *currently* in there;

#. run the following commands

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends cmake make # or any other generator
      mkdir build && cd build
      cmake ../path-helper-files
      sudo make install

#. run

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      ls /usr/local/bin

   again to check that ``latexindent.pl``, its modules and ``defaultSettings.yaml`` have been added.

To *remove* the files, run

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   sudo make uninstall

Add to path for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add ``latexindent.exe`` to the path for Windows, follow these steps:

#. download ``latexindent.exe``, ``defaultSettings.yaml``, ``add-to-path.bat`` from (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.) to your chosen directory;

#. open a command prompt and run the following command to see what is *currently* in your ``%path%`` variable;

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      echo %path%

#. right click on ``add-to-path.bat`` and *Run as administrator*;

#. log out, and log back in;

#. open a command prompt and run

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      echo %path%

   to check that the appropriate directory has been added to your ``%path%``.

To *remove* the directory from your ``%path%``, run ``remove-from-path.bat`` as administrator.

.. label follows

.. _sec:batches:

Batches of files
----------------

You can instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to operate on multiple files. For example, the following calls are all valid

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile1.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile1.tex myfile2.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile*.tex

We note the following features of the script in relation to the switches detailed in :numref:`sec:how:to:use`.

location of indent.log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``-c`` switch is *not* active, then ``indent.log`` goes to the directory of the final file called.

If the ``-c`` switch *is* active, then ``indent.log`` goes to the specified directory.

interaction with -w switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``-w`` switch is active, as in

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -w myfile*.tex

then files will be overwritten individually. Back-up files can be re-directed via the ``-c`` switch.

interaction with -o switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``latexindent.pl`` is called using the ``-o`` switch as in

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile*.tex -o=my-output-file.tex

and there are multiple files to operate upon, then the ``-o`` switch is ignored because there is only *one* output file specified.

More generally, if the ``-o`` switch does *not* have a ``+`` symbol at the beginning, then the ``-o`` switch will be ignored, and is turned it off.

For example

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile*.tex -o=+myfile

*will* work fine because *each* ``.tex`` file will output to ``<basename>myfile.tex``

Similarly,

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile*.tex -o=++

*will* work because the ‘existence check/incrementation’ routine will be applied.

interaction with lines switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This behaves as expected by attempting to operate on the line numbers specified for each file. See the examples in :numref:`sec:line-switch`.

interaction with check switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exit codes for ``latexindent.pl`` are given in :numref:`tab:exit-codes`.

When operating on multiple files with the check switch active, as in

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl myfile*.tex --check

then

-  exit code 0 means that the text from *none* of the files has been changed;

-  exit code 1 means that the text from *at least one* of the files been file changed.

The interaction with ``checkv`` switch is as in the check switch, but with verbose output.

when a file does not exist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What happens if one of the files can not be operated upon?

-  if at least one of the files does not exist and ``latexindent.pl`` has been called to act upon multiple files, then the exit code is 3; note that ``latexindent.pl`` will try to operate on each file that it is called upon, and will not exit with a fatal message in this case;

-  if at least one of the files can not be read and ``latexindent.pl`` has been called to act upon multiple files, then the exit code is 4; note that ``latexindent.pl`` will try to operate on each file that it is called upon, and will not exit with a fatal message in this case;

-  if ``latexindent.pl`` has been told to operate on multiple files, and some do not exist and some cannot be read, then the exit code will be either 3 or 4, depending upon which it scenario it encountered most recently.

latexindent-yaml-schema.json
----------------------------

``latexindent.pl`` ships with ``latexindent-yaml-schema.json`` which might help you when constructing your YAML files.

.. index:: json;schema for YAML files

VSCode demonstration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use ``latexindent-yaml-schema.json`` with ``VSCode``, you can use the following steps:

.. index:: VSCode

.. index:: json;VSCode

#. download ``latexindent-yaml-schema.json`` from the ``documentation`` folder of (“Home of Latexindent.pl” n.d.), save it in whichever directory you would like, noting it for reference;

#. following the instructions from (“How to Create Your Own Auto-Completion for Json and Yaml Files on Vs Code with the Help of Json Schema” n.d.), for example, you should install the VSCode YAML extension (“VSCode Yaml Extension” n.d.);

#. set up your ``settings.json`` file using the directory you saved the file by adapting :numref:`lst:settings.json`; on my Ubuntu laptop this file lives at ``/home/cmhughes/.config/Code/User/settings.json``.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/settings.json
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``settings.json`` 
	:name: lst:settings.json

Alternatively, if you would prefer not to download the json file, you might be able to use an adapted version of :numref:`lst:settings-alt.json`.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/settings-alt.json
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``settings-alt.json`` 
	:name: lst:settings-alt.json

Finally, if your TeX distribution is up to date, then ``latexindent-yaml-schema.json`` *should* be in the documentation folder of your installation, so an adapted version of :numref:`lst:settings-alt1.json` may work.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/settings-alt1.json
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``settings-alt1.json`` 
	:name: lst:settings-alt1.json

If you have details of how to implement this schema in other editors, please feel encouraged to contribute to this documentation.

.. label follows

.. _sec:app:conda:

Using conda
-----------

If you use conda you’ll only need

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   conda install latexindent.pl -c conda-forge

This will install the executable and all its dependencies (including perl) in the activate environment. You don’t even have to worry about ``defaultSettings.yaml`` as it included too, you can thus skip :numref:`sec:requiredmodules` and :numref:`sec:updating-path`.

.. index:: conda

You can get a conda installation for example from (“Conda Forge” n.d.) or from (“Anacoda” n.d.).

Sample conda installation on Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu I followed the 64-bit installation instructions at (“How to Install Anaconda on Ubuntu?” n.d.) and then I ran the following commands:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   conda create -n latexindent.pl
   conda activate latexindent.pl
   conda install latexindent.pl -c conda-forge
   conda info --envs
   conda list
   conda run latexindent.pl -vv

I found the details given at (“Solving Environment: Failed with Initial Frozen Solve. Retrying with Flexible Solve.” n.d.) to be helpful.

.. label follows

.. _sec:app:docker:

Using docker
------------

If you use docker you’ll only need

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   docker pull ghcr.io/cmhughes/latexindent.pl

This will download the image packed ``latexindent``\ ’s executable and its all dependencies.

.. index:: docker

Thank you to (eggplants 2022) for contributing this feature; see also (“Latexindent.pl Ghcr (Github Container Repository) Location” n.d.). For reference, *ghcr* stands for *GitHub Container Repository*.

Sample docker installation on Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To pull the image and show ``latexindent``\ ’s help on Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: latex
   :caption: ``docker-install.sh`` 
   :name: lst:docker-install

   # setup docker if not already installed
   if ! command -v docker &> /dev/null; then
     sudo apt install docker.io -y
     sudo groupadd docker
     sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" docker
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     newgrp docker
   fi

   # download image and execute
   docker pull ghcr.io/cmhughes/latexindent.pl
   docker run ghcr.io/cmhughes/latexindent.pl -h

Once I have run the above, on subsequent logins I run

.. code-block:: latex
   :caption: ``docker-install.sh`` 
   :name: lst:docker-install-subsequent

   newgrp docker
   docker run ghcr.io/cmhughes/latexindent.pl -h

How to format on Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use ``latexindent`` with the docker image, you have to mount target ``tex`` file like this:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   docker run -v /path/to/local/myfile.tex:/myfile.tex ghcr.io/cmhughes/latexindent.pl -s -w myfile.tex

pre-commit
----------

Users of ``.git`` may be interested in exploring the ``pre-commit`` tool (“Pre-Commit: A Framework for Managing and Maintaining Multi-Language Pre-Commit Hooks.” n.d.), which is supported by ``latexindent.pl``. Thank you to (Geus 2022) for contributing this feature, and to (Holthuis 2022) for their contribution to it.

To use the ``pre-commit`` tool, you will need to install ``pre-commit``; sample instructions for Ubuntu are given in :numref:`sec:pre-commit-ubuntu`. Once installed, there are two ways to use ``pre-commit``: using ``CPAN`` or using ``conda``, detailed in :numref:`sec:pre-commit-cpan` and :numref:`sec:pre-commit-conda` respectively.

.. label follows

.. _sec:pre-commit-ubuntu:

Sample pre-commit installation on Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu I ran the following command:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   python3 -m pip install pre-commit

I then updated my path via .bashrc so that it includes the line in :numref:`lst:bashrc-update`.

.. code-block:: latex
   :caption: ``.bashrc`` update 
   :name: lst:bashrc-update

   ...
   export PATH=$PATH:/home/cmhughes/.local/bin

pre-commit defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default values that are employed by ``pre-commit`` are shown in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-yaml-default`.

.. index:: pre-commit;default

.. literalinclude:: ../.pre-commit-hooks.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`` (default) 
	:name: lst:.pre-commit-yaml-default

In particular, the decision has deliberately been made (in collaboration with (Holthuis 2022)) to have the default to employ the following switches: ``overwriteIfDifferent``, ``silent``, ``local``; this is detailed in the lines that specify ``args`` in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-yaml-default`.

.. index:: pre-commit;warning

.. index:: warning;pre-commit

.. warning::	
	
	Users of ``pre-commit`` will, by default, have the ``overwriteIfDifferent`` switch employed. It is assumed that such users have version control in place, and are intending to overwrite their files.


.. label follows

.. _sec:pre-commit-cpan:

pre-commit using CPAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use ``latexindent.pl`` with ``pre-commit``, create the file ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` given in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan` in your git-repository.

.. index:: cpan

.. index:: git

.. index:: pre-commit;cpan

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/pre-commit-config-cpan.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` (cpan) 
	:name: lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan

Once created, you should then be able to run the following command:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   pre-commit run --all-files

A few notes about :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan`:

-  the settings given in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan` instruct ``pre-commit`` to use ``CPAN`` to get dependencies;

-  this requires ``pre-commit`` and ``perl`` to be installed on your system;

-  the ``args`` lists selected command-line options; the settings in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan` are equivalent to calling

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      latexindent.pl -s myfile.tex

   for each ``.tex`` file in your repository;

-  to instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to overwrite the files in your repository, then you can update :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan` so that ``args: [-s, -w]``.

Naturally you can add options, or omit ``-s`` and ``-w``, according to your preference.

.. label follows

.. _sec:pre-commit-conda:

pre-commit using conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also rely on ``conda`` (detailed in :numref:`sec:app:conda`) instead of ``CPAN`` for all dependencies, including ``latexindent.pl`` itself.

.. index:: conda

.. index:: git

.. index:: pre-commit;conda

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/pre-commit-config-conda.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` (conda) 
	:name: lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-conda

Once created, you should then be able to run the following command:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   pre-commit run --all-files

A few notes about :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan`:

-  the settings given in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-conda` instruct ``pre-commit`` to use ``conda`` to get dependencies;

-  this requires ``pre-commit`` and ``conda`` to be installed on your system;

-  the ``args`` lists selected command-line options; the settings in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan` are equivalent to calling

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      conda run latexindent.pl -s myfile.tex

   for each ``.tex`` file in your repository;

-  to instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to overwrite the files in your repository, then you can update :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan` so that ``args: [-s, -w]``.

.. label follows

.. _sec:pre-commit-docker:

pre-commit using docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also rely on ``docker`` (detailed in :numref:`sec:app:docker`) instead of ``CPAN`` for all dependencies, including ``latexindent.pl`` itself.

.. index:: docker

	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` (docker) 
	:name: lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-docker

Once created, you should then be able to run the following command:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   pre-commit run --all-files

A few notes about :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan`:

-  the settings given in :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-docker` instruct ``pre-commit`` to use ``docker`` to get dependencies;

-  this requires ``pre-commit`` and ``docker`` to be installed on your system;

   .. code-block:: latex
      :class: .commandshell

      docker run -v /path/to/myfile.tex:/myfile.tex ghcr.io/cmhughes/latexindent.pl -s myfile.tex

   for each ``.tex`` file in your repository;

-  to instruct ``latexindent.pl`` to overwrite the files in your repository, then you can update :numref:`lst:.pre-commit-config.yaml-cpan` so that ``args: [-s, -w]``.

pre-commit example using -l, -m switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s consider a small example, with local ``latexindent.pl`` settings in ``.latexindent.yaml``.

.. proof:example::	
	
	We use the local settings given in :numref:`lst:.latexindent.yaml`.
	
	.. code-block:: latex
	   :caption: ``.latexindent.yaml`` 
	   :name: lst:.latexindent.yaml
	
	   onlyOneBackUp: 1
	
	   modifyLineBreaks:
	    oneSentencePerLine:
	      manipulateSentences: 1
	
	and ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` as in :numref:`lst:.latexindent.yaml-switches`:
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/pre-commit-config-demo.yaml
		:class: .baseyaml
		:caption: ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` (demo) 
		:name: lst:.latexindent.yaml-switches
	
	Now running
	
	.. code-block:: latex
	   :class: .commandshell
	
	   pre-commit run --all-files

indentconfig options
--------------------

This section describes the possible locations for the main configuration file, discussed in :numref:`sec:indentconfig`. Thank you to (Nehctargl 2022) for this contribution. The possible locations of ``indentconfig.yaml`` are read one after the other, and reading stops when a valid file is found in one of the paths.

Before stating the list, we give summarise in :numref:`tab:environment:summary`.

.. label follows

.. _tab:environment:summary:

.. table:: indentconfig environment variable summaries

   ==================== ================= ===== ===== =======
   environment variable type              Linux macOS Windows
   ==================== ================= ===== ===== =======
   LATEXINDENT_CONFIG   full path to file yes   yes   yes
   XDG_CONFIG_HOME      directory path    yes   no    no
   LOCALAPPDATA         directory path    no    no    yes
   ==================== ================= ===== ===== =======

The following list shows the checked options and is sorted by their respective priority. It uses capitalized and with a dollar symbol prefixed names (e.g. ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG``) to symbolize environment variables. In addition to that the variable name ``$homeDir`` is used to symbolize your home directory.

#. The value of the environment variable ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG`` is treated as highest priority source for the path to the configuration file.

#. The next options are dependent on your operating system:

   -  Linux:

      #. The file at ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/latexindent/indentconfig.yaml``

      #. The file at ``$homeDir/.config/latexindent/indentconfig.yaml``

   -  Windows:

      #. The file at ``$LOCALAPPDATA\latexindent\indentconfig.yaml``

      #. The file at ``$homeDir\AppData\Local\latexindent\indentconfig.yaml``

   -  Mac:

      #. The file at ``$homeDir/Library/Preferences/latexindent/indentconfig.yaml``

#. The file at ``$homeDir/indentconfig.yaml``

#. The file at ``$homeDir/.indentconfig.yaml``

Why to change the configuration location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is mostly a question about what you prefer, some like to put all their configuration files in their home directory (see ``$homeDir`` above), whilst some like to sort their configuration. And if you don’t care about it, you can just continue using the same defaults.

How to change the configuration location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This depends on your preferred location, if, for example, you would like to set a custom location, you would have to change the ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG`` environment variable.

Although the following example only covers ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG``, the same process can be applied to ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` or ``$LOCALAPPDATA`` because both are environment variables. You just have to change the path to your chosen configuration directory (e.g. ``$homeDir/.config`` or ``$homeDir\AppData\Local`` on Linux or Windows respectively)

.. label follows

.. _linux-1:

Linux
~~~~~

To change ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG`` on Linux you can run the following command in a terminal after changing the path:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   echo 'export LATEXINDENT_CONFIG="/home/cmh/latexindent-config.yaml"' >> ~/.profile

Context: This command adds the given line to your ``.profile`` file (which is commonly stored in ``$HOME/.profile``). All commands in this file a run after login, so the environment variable will be set after your next login.

You can check the value of ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG`` by typing

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   echo $LATEXINDENT_CONFIG 
   /home/cmh/latexindent-config.yaml

Linux users interested in ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` can explore variations of the following commands

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
   echo ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=$HOME/.config}
   echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
   mkdir /home/cmh/.config/latexindent
   touch /home/cmh/.config/latexindent/indentconfig.yaml

.. label follows

.. _windows-1:

Windows
~~~~~~~

To change ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG`` on Windows you can run the following command in ``powershell.exe`` after changing the path:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable
       ("LATEXINDENT_CONFIG", "\your\config\path", "User")

This sets the environment variable for every user session.

.. label follows

.. _mac-1:

Mac
~~~

To change ``$LATEXINDENT_CONFIG`` on macOS you can run the following command in a terminal after changing the path:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   echo 'export LATEXINDENT_CONFIG="/your/config/path"' >> ~/.profile

Context: This command adds the line to your ``.profile`` file (which is commonly stored in ``$HOME/.profile``). All commands in this file a run after login, so the environment variable will be set after your next login.

paths demonstration
-------------------

As detailed in :numref:`subsec:indentconfig` , the ``paths`` field can be specified in any of your ``YAML`` files.

We will use the file in :numref:`lst:paths-demo` for demonstration in what follows.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/paths-demo.tex
	:class: .tex
	:caption: ``paths-demo.tex`` 
	:name: lst:paths-demo

.. proof:example::	
	
	Consider the settings given in :numref:`lst:path1-yaml` and :numref:`lst:path2-yaml`.
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/path1.yaml
		:class: .baseyaml
		:caption: ``path1.yaml`` 
		:name: lst:path1-yaml
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/path2.yaml
		:class: .baseyaml
		:caption: ``path2.yaml`` 
		:name: lst:path2-yaml
	
	Upon calling
	
	.. code-block:: latex
	   :class: .commandshell
	
	   latexindent.pl -l=path1.yaml paths-demo.tex
	
	then we will receive the output given in :numref:`lst:paths-demo-mod1`.
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/paths-demo-mod1.tex
		:class: .tex
		:caption: ``paths-demo-mod1.tex`` 
		:name: lst:paths-demo-mod1
	
	We note that the settings from :numref:`lst:path2-yaml` have been called from :numref:`lst:path1-yaml`.
	
	On inspection of ``indent.log`` from the above call, we see the details of this part of the process given in :numref:`lst:path-test1:txt`.
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/path-test1.txt
		:class: .tex
		:caption: ``path-test1.txt`` 
		:name: lst:path-test1:txt
	


.. proof:example::	
	
	Consider the settings given in :numref:`lst:path3-yaml` to :numref:`lst:path5-yaml`.
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/path3.yaml
		:class: .baseyaml
		:caption: ``path3.yaml`` 
		:name: lst:path3-yaml
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/path4.yaml
		:class: .baseyaml
		:caption: ``path4.yaml`` 
		:name: lst:path4-yaml
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/path5.yaml
		:class: .baseyaml
		:caption: ``path5.yaml`` 
		:name: lst:path5-yaml
	
	Upon calling
	
	.. code-block:: latex
	   :class: .commandshell
	
	   latexindent.pl -l=path3.yaml paths-demo.tex
	
	then we will receive the output given in :numref:`lst:paths-demo-mod3`.
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/paths-demo-mod3.tex
		:class: .tex
		:caption: ``paths-demo-mod3.tex`` 
		:name: lst:paths-demo-mod3
	
	We see that ``path3.yaml`` calls ``path4.yaml`` which in turn calls ``path5.yaml``.
	
	On inspection of ``indent.log`` from the above call, we see the details of this part of the process given in :numref:`lst:path-test3:txt`.
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/path-test3.txt

.. _app:logfile-demo:

logFilePreferences
------------------

:numref:`lst:logFilePreferences` describes the options for customising the information given to the log file, and we provide a few demonstrations here.

.. proof:example::	
	
	Let’s say that we start with the code given in :numref:`lst:simple`, and the settings specified in :numref:`lst:logfile-prefs1-yaml`.
	
	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/simple.tex
		:class: .tex
		:caption: ``simple.tex``

	.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/logfile-prefs1.yaml
		:class: .baseyaml
		:caption: ``logfile-prefs1.yaml`` 
		:name: lst:logfile-prefs1-yaml
	
	If we run the following command (noting that ``-t`` is active)
	
	.. code-block:: latex
	   :class: .commandshell
	
	   latexindent.pl -t -l=logfile-prefs1.yaml simple.tex
	
	then on inspection of ``indent.log`` we will find the snippet given in :numref:`lst:indentlog`.
	
	.. code-block:: latex
	   :caption: ``indent.log`` 
	   :name: lst:indentlog

.. _app:encoding:

Encoding
--------

When using latexindent in different ways on different systems, the range of characters supported by its switches/flags/options (see :numref:`sec:commandline`) may vary.

For the Windows executable file ``latexindent.exe``, its options support UTF-8 characters.

For the Windows Perl script ``latexindent.pl``, its option switch supports the characters supported by the encoding corresponding to the system code page. You can check the system code page by running the following command in either ``cmd.exe`` or ``powershell.exe``:

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

     chcp

which may receive the following result

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

     Active code page: 936

and then the characters supported by the code page can be found in `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/code-page-identifiers <Microsoft's
  code page identifier
  table>`__. For example, the characters supported by the encoding corresponding to code page 936 are: ANSI/OEM Simplified Chinese (PRC, Singapore); Chinese Simplified (GB2312).

For Ubuntu Linux and macOS users, whether using the Perl script or the executable file, the options support UTF-8 characters.

dos2unix linebreak adjustment
-----------------------------

.. describe:: dos2unixlinebreaks:integer

If you use ``latexindent.pl`` on a dos-based Windows file on Linux then you may find that trailing horizontal space is not removed as you hope.

In such a case, you may wish to try setting ``dos2unixlinebreaks`` to 1 and employing, for example, the following command.

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -y="dos2unixlinebreaks:1" myfile.tex

See (“Windows Line Breaks on Linux Prevent Removal of White Space from End of Line” n.d.) for further dertails.

.. label follows

.. _app:differences:

Differences from Version 2.2 to 3.0
-----------------------------------

There are a few (small) changes to the interface when comparing Version 2.2 to Version 3.0. Explicitly, in previous versions you might have run, for example,

.. index:: switches;-o demonstration

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -o myfile.tex outputfile.tex

whereas in Version 3.0 you would run any of the following, for example,

.. index:: switches;-o demonstration

.. code-block:: latex
   :class: .commandshell

   latexindent.pl -o=outputfile.tex myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl -o outputfile.tex myfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o outputfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=outputfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -outputfile=outputfile.tex
   latexindent.pl myfile.tex -outputfile outputfile.tex

noting that the *output* file is given *next to* the ``-o`` switch.

The fields given in :numref:`lst:obsoleteYaml` are *obsolete* from Version 3.0 onwards.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/obsolete.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: Obsolete YAML fields from Version 3.0 
	:name: lst:obsoleteYaml

There is a slight difference when specifying indentation after headings; specifically, we now write ``indentAfterThisHeading`` instead of ``indent``. See :numref:`lst:indentAfterThisHeadingOld` and :numref:`lst:indentAfterThisHeadingNew`

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/indentAfterThisHeadingOld.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``indentAfterThisHeading`` in Version 2.2 
	:name: lst:indentAfterThisHeadingOld

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/indentAfterThisHeadingNew.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``indentAfterThisHeading`` in Version 3.0 
	:name: lst:indentAfterThisHeadingNew

To specify ``noAdditionalIndent`` for display-math environments in Version 2.2, you would write YAML as in :numref:`lst:noAdditionalIndentOld`; as of Version 3.0, you would write YAML as in :numref:`lst:indentAfterThisHeadingNew1` or, if you’re using ``-m`` switch, :numref:`lst:indentAfterThisHeadingNew2`.

.. index:: specialBeginEnd;update to displaymath V3.0

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/noAddtionalIndentOld.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``noAdditionalIndent`` in Version 2.2 
	:name: lst:noAdditionalIndentOld

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/noAddtionalIndentNew.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``noAdditionalIndent`` for ``displayMath`` in Version 3.0 
	:name: lst:indentAfterThisHeadingNew1

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/noAddtionalIndentNew1.yaml
	:class: .baseyaml
	:caption: ``noAdditionalIndent`` for ``displayMath`` in Version 3.0
