\section{Conclusions and known limitations}\label{sec:knownlimitations}
 There are a number of known limitations of the script, and almost certainly quite a few
 that are \emph{unknown}!

 For example, with reference to the multicolumn alignment routine in
 \vref{lst:tabular2-mod2}, when working with code blocks in which multicolumn commands
 overlap, the algorithm can fail.

 Another limitation is to do with efficiency, particularly when the \texttt{-m} switch is
 active, as this adds many checks and processes. The current implementation relies upon
 finding and storing \emph{every} code block (see the discussion on
 \cpageref{page:phases}); I hope that, in a future version, only \emph{nested} code blocks
 will need to be stored in the `packing' phase, and that this will improve the efficiency
 of the script.

 You can run \texttt{latexindent} on any file;%
 \announce{2019-07-13}*{ability to call latexindent on any file} if you don't specify an
 extension, then the extensions that you specify in
 \lstinline[breaklines=true]!fileExtensionPreference! (see
 \vref{lst:fileExtensionPreference}) will be consulted. If you find a case in which the
 script struggles, please feel free to report it at \cite{latexindent-home}, and in the
 meantime, consider using a \texttt{noIndentBlock} (see \cpageref{lst:noIndentBlock}).

 I hope that this script is useful to some; if you find an example where the script does
 not behave as you think it should, the best way to contact me is to report an issue on
 \cite{latexindent-home}; otherwise, feel free to find me on the
