\subsection{oneSentencePerLine: modifying line breaks for sentences}\label{sec:onesentenceperline}

 You can instruct \texttt{latexindent.pl} to format \announce{2018-01-13}{one sentence
 per line} your file so that it puts one sentence per line. Thank you to \cite{mlep} for
 helping to shape and test this feature. The behaviour of this part of the script is
 controlled by the switches detailed in \cref{lst:oneSentencePerLine}, all of which we
 discuss next. \index{modifying linebreaks! by using one sentence per line}
 \index{sentences!oneSentencePerLine} \index{sentences!one sentence per line}
 \index{regular expressions!lowercase alph a-z} \index{regular expressions!uppercase alph
 A-Z}%

 \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=oneSentencePerLine]{../defaultSettings.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.85\linewidth,before=\centering]{\texttt{oneSentencePerLine}}{lst:oneSentencePerLine}

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: overview}
 An overview of how the oneSentencePerLine routine feature works:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item the default value of \texttt{manipulateSentences} is 0, which means that
        oneSentencePerLine will \emph{not} happen by default;
  \item it happens \emph{after} verbatim blocks have been found;
  \item it happens \emph{before} the text wrapping routine (see
        \cref{subsec:textwrapping});
  \item it happens \emph{before} the main code blocks have been found;
  \item sentences to be found:
        \begin{enumerate}
         \item \emph{follow} the fields specified in \texttt{sentencesFollow}
         \item \emph{begin} with the fields specified in \texttt{sentencesBeginWith}
         \item \emph{end} with the fields specified in \texttt{sentencesEndWith}
        \end{enumerate}
  \item by default, the oneSentencePerLine routine will remove line breaks within
        sentences because \texttt{removeBlockLineBreaks} is set to 1; switch it to 0 if
        you wish to change this;
  \item sentences can be text wrapped according to \texttt{textWrapSentences}, and will
        be done either \texttt{before} or \texttt{after} the main indentation routine
        (see \cref{subsubsec:ospl:before:after});
  \item about trailing comments within text wrap blocks:
        \begin{enumerate}
         \item multiple trailing comments will be connected at the end of the sentence;
         \item the number of spaces between the end of the sentence and the (possibly
               combined) trailing comments is determined by the spaces (if any) at the
               end of the sentence.
        \end{enumerate}
 \end{enumerate}

 We demonstrate this feature using a series of examples.
\yamltitle{manipulateSentences}{0|1}
 This is a binary switch that details if \texttt{latexindent.pl} should perform the
 sentence manipulation routine; it is \emph{off} (set to \texttt{0}) by default, and you
 will need to turn it on (by setting it to \texttt{1}) if you want the script to modify
 line breaks surrounding and within sentences.

\yamltitle{removeSentenceLineBreaks}{0|1}
 When operating upon sentences \texttt{latexindent.pl} will, by default, remove internal
 line breaks as \texttt{removeSentenceLineBreaks} is set to \texttt{1}. Setting this
 switch to \texttt{0} instructs \texttt{latexindent.pl} not to do so.
 \index{sentences!removing sentence line breaks}

 \begin{example}
 For example, consider \texttt{multiple-sentences.tex} shown in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences}

 If we use the YAML files in
 \cref{lst:manipulate-sentences-yaml,lst:keep-sen-line-breaks-yaml}, and run the commands
 \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration}
 \begin{widepage}

  \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences -m -l=keep-sen-line-breaks.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 \end{widepage}
 then we obtain the respective output given in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod1,lst:multiple-sentences-mod2}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences.tex} using \cref{lst:manipulate-sentences-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences-mod1}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/manipulate-sentences.yaml}[MLB-TCB]{\texttt{manipulate-sentences.yaml}}{lst:manipulate-sentences-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences-mod2.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences.tex} using \cref{lst:keep-sen-line-breaks-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences-mod2}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/keep-sen-line-breaks.yaml}[MLB-TCB]{\texttt{keep-sen-line-breaks.yaml}}{lst:keep-sen-line-breaks-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 Notice, in particular, that the `internal' sentence line breaks in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences} have been removed in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod1},
 but have not been removed in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod2}.
 \end{example}

\yamltitle{multipleSpacesToSingle}{0|1}
 \announce{2022-03-25}*{multipleSpacesToSingle for oneSentencePerLine} By default, the
 one-sentence-per-line routine will convert multiple spaces into single spaces. You can
 change this behaviour by changing the switch \texttt{multipleSpacesToSingle} to a value
 of \texttt{0}.

 The remainder of the settings displayed in \vref{lst:oneSentencePerLine} instruct
 \texttt{latexindent.pl} on how to define a sentence. From the perspective of
 \texttt{latexindent.pl} a sentence must: \index{sentences!follow} \index{sentences!begin
 with} \index{sentences!end with}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{follow} a certain character or set of characters (see
        \cref{lst:sentencesFollow}); by default, this is either \lstinline!\par!, a
        blank line, a full stop/period (.), exclamation mark (!), question mark (?) right brace
        (\}) or a comment on the previous line;
  \item \emph{begin} with a character type (see \cref{lst:sentencesBeginWith}); by
        default, this is only capital letters;
  \item \emph{end} with a character (see \cref{lst:sentencesEndWith}); by
        default, these are full stop/period (.), exclamation mark (!) and question mark (?).
 \end{itemize}
 In each case, you can specify the \texttt{other} field to include any pattern that you
 would like; you can specify anything in this field using the language of regular
 expressions. \index{regular expressions!lowercase alph a-z} \index{regular
 expressions!uppercase alph A-Z}

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[raster columns=2,
   raster left skip=-3.5cm,
   raster right skip=-2cm,
   raster column skip=.06\linewidth]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=sentencesFollow]{../defaultSettings.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.9\linewidth,before=\centering]{\texttt{sentencesFollow}}{lst:sentencesFollow}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=sentencesBeginWith]{../defaultSettings.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.9\linewidth,before=\centering]{\texttt{sentencesBeginWith}}{lst:sentencesBeginWith}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=sentencesEndWith]{../defaultSettings.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.9\linewidth,before=\centering]{\texttt{sentencesEndWith}}{lst:sentencesEndWith}

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: sentencesFollow}
 Let's explore a few of the switches in \texttt{sentencesFollow}.

 \begin{example}
 We start with \vref{lst:multiple-sentences}, and use the YAML settings given in
 \cref{lst:sentences-follow1-yaml}. Using the command \index{sentences!follow}
 \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences -m -l=sentences-follow1.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 we obtain the output given in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod3}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences-mod3.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences.tex} using \cref{lst:sentences-follow1-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences-mod3}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentences-follow1.yaml}[MLB-TCB]{\texttt{sentences-follow1.yaml}}{lst:sentences-follow1-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 Notice that, because \texttt{blankLine} is set to \texttt{0}, \texttt{latexindent.pl}
 will not seek sentences following a blank line, and so the fourth sentence has not been
 accounted for.
 \end{example}

 \begin{example}
 We can explore the \texttt{other} field in \cref{lst:sentencesFollow} with the
 \texttt{.tex} file detailed in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences1}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences1.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences1}

 Upon running the following commands \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m
 demonstration}
 \begin{widepage}

  \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences1 -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences1 -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml,sentences-follow2.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 \end{widepage}
 then we obtain the respective output given in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences1-mod1,lst:multiple-sentences1-mod2}.
 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences1-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences1.tex} using \vref{lst:manipulate-sentences-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences1-mod1}

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[
   raster force size=false,
   raster column 1/.style={add to width=1cm},
  ]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences1-mod2.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences1.tex} using \cref{lst:sentences-follow2-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences1-mod2}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentences-follow2.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.45\textwidth]{\texttt{sentences-follow2.yaml}}{lst:sentences-follow2-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 Notice that in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences1-mod1} the first sentence after the
 \texttt{)} has not been accounted for, but that following the inclusion of
 \cref{lst:sentences-follow2-yaml}, the output given in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences1-mod2} demonstrates that the sentence \emph{has} been
 accounted for correctly.
 \end{example}

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: sentencesBeginWith}
 By default, \texttt{latexindent.pl} will only assume that sentences begin with the upper
 case letters \texttt{A-Z}; you can instruct the script to define sentences to begin with
 lower case letters (see \cref{lst:sentencesBeginWith}), and we can use the
 \texttt{other} field to define sentences to begin with other characters.
 \index{sentences!begin with}

 \begin{example}
 We use the file in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences2}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences2.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences2.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences2}

 Upon running the following commands \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m
 demonstration}
 \begin{widepage}

  \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences2 -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences2 -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml,sentences-begin1.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 \end{widepage}
 then we obtain the respective output given in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences2-mod1,lst:multiple-sentences2-mod2}.
 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences2-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences2.tex} using \vref{lst:manipulate-sentences-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences2-mod1}
 \index{regular expressions!numeric 0-9}

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[
   raster force size=false,
   raster column 1/.style={add to width=1cm},
  ]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences2-mod2.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences2.tex} using \cref{lst:sentences-begin1-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences2-mod2}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentences-begin1.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.45\textwidth]{\texttt{sentences-begin1.yaml}}{lst:sentences-begin1-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}
 Notice that in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences2-mod1}, the first sentence has been
 accounted for but that the subsequent sentences have not. In
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences2-mod2}, all of the sentences have been accounted for,
 because the \texttt{other} field in \cref{lst:sentences-begin1-yaml} has defined
 sentences to begin with either \lstinline!$! or any numeric digit, \texttt{0} to
 \texttt{9}.
 \end{example}

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: sentencesEndWith}
 \begin{example}
 Let's return to \vref{lst:multiple-sentences}; we have already seen the default way in
 which \texttt{latexindent.pl} will operate on the sentences in this file in
 \vref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod1}. We can populate the \texttt{other} field with any
 character that we wish; for example, using the YAML specified in
 \cref{lst:sentences-end1-yaml} and the command \index{sentences!end with}
 \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences -m -l=sentences-end1.yaml
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences -m -l=sentences-end2.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 then we obtain the output in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod4}. \index{regular
 expressions!lowercase alph a-z}

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences-mod4.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences.tex} using \cref{lst:sentences-end1-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences-mod4}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentences-end1.yaml}[MLB-TCB]{\texttt{sentences-end1.yaml}}{lst:sentences-end1-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences-mod5.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences.tex} using \cref{lst:sentences-end2-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences-mod5}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentences-end2.yaml}[MLB-TCB]{\texttt{sentences-end2.yaml}}{lst:sentences-end2-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 There is a subtle difference between the output in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod4,lst:multiple-sentences-mod5}; in particular, in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod4} the word \texttt{sentence} has not been defined as a
 sentence, because we have not instructed \texttt{latexindent.pl} to begin sentences with
 lower case letters. We have changed this by using the settings in
 \cref{lst:sentences-end2-yaml}, and the associated output in
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences-mod5} reflects this.
 \end{example}

 Referencing \vref{lst:sentencesEndWith}, you'll notice that there is a field called
 \texttt{basicFullStop}, which is set to \texttt{0}, and that the \texttt{betterFullStop}
 is set to \texttt{1} by default.

 \begin{example}
 Let's consider the file shown in \cref{lst:url}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/url.tex}{\texttt{url.tex}}{lst:url}

 Upon running the following commands \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m
 demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl url -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 we obtain the output given in \cref{lst:url-mod1}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/url-mod1.tex}{\texttt{url.tex} using \vref{lst:manipulate-sentences-yaml}}{lst:url-mod1}

 Notice that the full stop within the url has been interpreted correctly. This is
 because, within the \texttt{betterFullStop}, full stops at the end of sentences have the
 following properties:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item they are ignored within \texttt{e.g.} and \texttt{i.e.};
  \item they can not be immediately followed by a lower case or upper case letter;
  \item they can not be immediately followed by a hyphen, comma, or number.
 \end{itemize}
 \end{example}

 If you find that the \texttt{betterFullStop} does not work for your purposes, then you
 can switch it off by setting it to \texttt{0}, and you can experiment with the
 \texttt{other} field. \announce{2019-07-13}{fine tuning the betterFullStop} You can also
 seek to customise the \texttt{betterFullStop} routine by using the \emph{fine tuning},
 detailed in \vref{lst:fineTuning}.%

 The \texttt{basicFullStop} routine should probably be avoided in most situations, as it
 does not accommodate the specifications above.

 \begin{example}
 For example, using the following command \index{switches!-l demonstration}
 \index{switches!-m demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl url -m -l=alt-full-stop1.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 and the YAML in \cref{lst:alt-full-stop1-yaml} gives the output in \cref{lst:url-mod2}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[ raster left skip=-3.5cm,
   raster right skip=-2cm,
   raster force size=false,
   raster column 1/.style={add to width=.1\textwidth},
   raster column skip=.06\linewidth]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/url-mod2.tex}{\texttt{url.tex} using \cref{lst:alt-full-stop1-yaml}}{lst:url-mod2}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/alt-full-stop1.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.5\textwidth]{\texttt{alt-full-stop1.yaml}}{lst:alt-full-stop1-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 Notice that the full stop within the URL has not been accommodated correctly because of
 the non-default settings in \cref{lst:alt-full-stop1-yaml}.
 \end{example}

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: sentencesDoNOTcontain}
 You can specify patterns that sentences do \emph{not} contain using the field
 \announce{new}{oneSentencePerLine: sentencesDoNOTcontain} in
 \cref{lst:sentencesDoNOTcontain}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile*[style=sentencesDoNOTcontain]{../defaultSettings.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.9\linewidth,before=\centering]{\texttt{sentencesDoNOTcontain}}{lst:sentencesDoNOTcontain}

 If sentences run across environments then, by default, they will \emph{not} be
 considered a sentence by \texttt{latexindent.pl}. \announce{new}*{updated example of
 oneSentencePerLine}
 \begin{example}
 For example, if we use the \texttt{.tex} file in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences4}

 \cmhlistingsfromfile*{demonstrations/multiple-sentences4.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences4.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences4}

 and run the command \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences4 -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 then the output is unchanged, because the default value of
 \texttt{sentencesDoNOTcontain} says, \emph{sentences do NOT contain}

 This means that, by default, \texttt{latexindent.pl} does \emph{not} consider the file
 in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences4} to have a sentence. \lstinline!\\begin!
 \end{example}

 \begin{example}
 We can customise the \texttt{sentencesDoNOTcontain} field with anything that we do
 \emph{not} want sentences to contain.

 We begin with the file in \cref{lst:sentence-dnc1}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile*{demonstrations/sentence-dnc1.tex}{\texttt{sentence-dnc1.tex}}{lst:sentence-dnc1}

 Upon running the following commands

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl sentence-dnc1.tex -m -l=dnc1.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 then we obtain the output given in \cref{lst:sentence-dnc1-mod1}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[ raster left skip=-2.5cm,
   raster right skip=-1cm,
   raster force size=false,
   raster column 1/.style={add to width=3cm},
  ]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile*{demonstrations/sentence-dnc1-mod1.tex}{\texttt{sentence-dnc1-mod1.tex}}{lst:sentence-dnc1-mod1}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile*[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/dnc1.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.45\textwidth]{\texttt{dnc1.yaml}}{lst:dnc1-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 The settings in \cref{lst:dnc1-yaml} say that sentences do \emph{not} contain
 \lstinline!\begin! and that they do not contain \lstinline!\cmh!
 \end{example}

 \begin{example}
 We can implement case insensitivity for the \texttt{sentencesDoNOTcontain} field.

 We begin with the file in \cref{lst:sentence-dnc2}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile*{demonstrations/sentence-dnc2.tex}{\texttt{sentence-dnc2.tex}}{lst:sentence-dnc2}

 Upon running the following commands

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl sentence-dnc2.tex -m -l=dnc2.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 then we obtain the output given in \cref{lst:sentence-dnc2-mod2}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[ raster left skip=-2.5cm,
   raster right skip=-1cm,
   raster force size=false,
   raster column 1/.style={add to width=3cm},
  ]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile*{demonstrations/sentence-dnc2-mod2.tex}{\texttt{sentence-dnc2-mod2.tex}}{lst:sentence-dnc2-mod2}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile*[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/dnc2.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.45\textwidth]{\texttt{dnc2.yaml}}{lst:dnc2-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 The settings in \cref{lst:dnc2-yaml} say that sentences do \emph{not} contain
 \lstinline!\begin! and that they do not contain \emph{case insensitive} versions of
 \lstinline!\cmh!
 \end{example}
 \begin{example}
 We can turn off \texttt{sentenceDoNOTcontain} by setting it to \texttt{0} as in
 \cref{lst:dnc-off-yaml}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile*[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/dnc-off.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=.45\textwidth]{\texttt{dnc-off.yaml}}{lst:dnc-off-yaml}

 The settings in \cref{lst:dnc-off-yaml} mean that sentences can contain any character.
 \end{example}

\subsubsection{Features of the oneSentencePerLine routine}
 The sentence manipulation routine takes place \emph{after} verbatim \index{verbatim!in
 relation to oneSentencePerLine} environments, preamble and trailing comments have been
 accounted for; this means that any characters within these types of code blocks will not
 be part of the sentence manipulation routine.

 \begin{example}
 For example, if we begin with the \texttt{.tex} file in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences3},
 and run the command \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences3 -m -l=manipulate-sentences.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 then we obtain the output in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences3-mod1}.
 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences3.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences3.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences3}
 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences3-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences3.tex} using \vref{lst:manipulate-sentences-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences3-mod1}
 \end{example}

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: text wrapping and indenting sentences}
 The \texttt{oneSentencePerLine} \announce{2018-08-13}{oneSentencePerline text wrap and
 indent} can be instructed to perform text wrapping and indentation upon sentences.
 \index{sentences!text wrapping} \index{sentences!indenting}%

 \begin{example}
 Let's use the code in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences5}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences5.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences5.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences5}

 Referencing \cref{lst:sentence-wrap1-yaml}, and running the following command
 \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences5 -m -l=sentence-wrap1.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 we receive the output given in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences5-mod1}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[ raster left skip=-3.5cm,
   raster right skip=-2cm,
   raster force size=false,
   raster column 1/.style={add to width=.1\textwidth},
   raster column skip=.06\linewidth]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences5-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences5.tex} using \cref{lst:sentence-wrap1-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences5-mod1}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentence-wrap1.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=0.5\textwidth]{\texttt{sentence-wrap1.yaml}}{lst:sentence-wrap1-yaml}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}
 \end{example}

 If you specify \texttt{textWrapSentences} as 1, but do \emph{not} specify a value for
 \texttt{columns} then the text wrapping will \emph{not} operate on sentences, and you
 will see a warning in \texttt{indent.log}.

 \begin{example}
 The indentation of sentences requires that sentences are stored as code blocks. This
 means that you may need to tweak \vref{lst:sentencesEndWith}. Let's explore this in
 relation to \cref{lst:multiple-sentences6}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences6.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences6.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences6}

 By default, \texttt{latexindent.pl} will find the full-stop within the first
 \texttt{item}, which means that, upon running the following commands \index{switches!-l
 demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration} \index{switches!-y demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences6 -m -l=sentence-wrap1.yaml 
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences6 -m -l=sentence-wrap1.yaml -y="modifyLineBreaks:oneSentencePerLine:sentenceIndent:''"
\end{commandshell}

 we receive the respective output in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences6-mod1} and
 \cref{lst:multiple-sentences6-mod2}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences6-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences6-mod1.tex} using \cref{lst:sentence-wrap1-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences6-mod1}

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences6-mod2.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences6-mod2.tex} using \cref{lst:sentence-wrap1-yaml} and no sentence indentation}{lst:multiple-sentences6-mod2}

 We note that \cref{lst:multiple-sentences6-mod1} the \texttt{itemize} code block has
 \emph{not} been indented appropriately. This is because the oneSentencePerLine has been
 instructed to store sentences (because \cref{lst:sentence-wrap1-yaml}); each sentence is
 then searched for code blocks.
 \end{example}

 \begin{example}
 We can tweak the settings in \vref{lst:sentencesEndWith} to ensure that full stops are
 not followed by \texttt{item} commands, and that the end of sentences contains
 \lstinline!\end{itemize}! as in \cref{lst:itemize-yaml}. This setting is actually an
 appended version of the \texttt{betterFullStop} from the \texttt{fineTuning}, detailed
 in \vref{lst:fineTuning}. \index{regular expressions!lowercase alph a-z} \index{regular
 expressions!uppercase alph A-Z} \index{regular expressions!numeric 0-9} \index{regular

 Upon running \index{switches!-l demonstration} \index{switches!-m demonstration}

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences6 -m -l=sentence-wrap1.yaml,itemize.yaml
\end{commandshell}

 we receive the output in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences6-mod3}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences6-mod3.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences6-mod3.tex} using \cref{lst:sentence-wrap1-yaml} and \cref{lst:itemize-yaml}}{lst:multiple-sentences6-mod3}

 Notice that the sentence has received indentation, and that the \texttt{itemize} code
 block has been found and indented correctly.
 \end{example}

 Text \announce{2022-04-04}*{oneSentencePerLine text wrapping update} wrapping when using
 the \texttt{oneSentencePerLine} routine determines if it will remove line breaks while
 text wrapping, from the value of \texttt{removeSentenceLineBreaks}.

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: text wrapping and indenting sentences, when before/after}\label{subsubsec:ospl:before:after}
 The text wrapping routine operates, by default, \texttt{before} the
 \announce{2023-01-01}{text wrap: before/after details} code blocks have been found, but
 this can be changed to \texttt{after}:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{before} means it is likely that the columns of wrapped text may \emph{exceed} the
        value specified in \texttt{columns};
  \item \texttt{after} means it columns of wrapped text should \emph{not} exceed the value
        specified in \texttt{columns}.
 \end{itemize}
 We demonstrate this in the following examples. See also
 \cref{subsubsec:tw:before:after}.

 \begin{example}
 Let's begin with the file in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences8}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences8.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences8.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences8}

 Using the settings given in \cref{lst:sentence-wrap2} and running the command

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences8 -o=+-mod1.tex -l=sentence-wrap2 -m
   \end{commandshell}

 gives the output given in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences8-mod1}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[raster columns=2,
   raster left skip=-1.5cm,
   raster right skip=-0cm,
   raster column skip=.06\linewidth]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences8-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences8-mod1.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences8-mod1}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentence-wrap2.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=0.4\linewidth]{\texttt{sentence-wrap2.yaml}}{lst:sentence-wrap2}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 We note that, in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences8-mod1}, that the wrapped text has
 \emph{exceeded} the specified value of \texttt{columns} (35) given in
 \cref{lst:sentence-wrap2}. We can affect this by changing \texttt{when}; we explore this
 next.
 \end{example}

 \begin{example}
 We continue working with \cref{lst:multiple-sentences8}.

 Using the settings given in \cref{lst:sentence-wrap3} and running the command

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences8.tex -o=+-mod2.tex -l=sentence-wrap3 -m
   \end{commandshell}

 gives the output given in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences8-mod2}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[raster columns=2,
   raster left skip=-1.5cm,
   raster right skip=-0cm,
   raster column skip=.06\linewidth]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences8-mod2.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences8-mod2.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences8-mod2}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentence-wrap3.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=0.4\linewidth]{\texttt{sentence-wrap3.yaml}}{lst:sentence-wrap3}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 We note that, in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences8-mod2}, that the wrapped text has
 \emph{obeyed} the specified value of \texttt{columns} (35) given in
 \cref{lst:sentence-wrap3}.
 \end{example}

\subsubsection{oneSentencePerLine: text wrapping sentences and comments}\label{subsubsec:ospl:tw:comments}
 We demonstrate the one sentence per line routine with respect to text wrapping
 \emph{comments}. See also \cref{subsubsec:tw:comments}. \index{comments!text wrap}
 \index{text wrap!comments} \index{sentences!comments} \index{sentences!text wrap}

 \begin{example}
 Let's begin with the file in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences9}.

 \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences9.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences9.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences9}

 Using the settings given in \cref{lst:sentence-wrap4} and running the command

 \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl multiple-sentences9 -o=+-mod1.tex -l=sentence-wrap4 -m
   \end{commandshell}

 gives the output given in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences9-mod1}.

 \begin{cmhtcbraster}[raster columns=2,
   raster left skip=-1.5cm,
   raster right skip=-0cm,
   raster column skip=.06\linewidth]
  \cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/multiple-sentences9-mod1.tex}{\texttt{multiple-sentences9-mod1.tex}}{lst:multiple-sentences9-mod1}
  \cmhlistingsfromfile[style=yaml-LST]{demonstrations/sentence-wrap4.yaml}[MLB-TCB,width=0.4\linewidth]{\texttt{sentence-wrap4.yaml}}{lst:sentence-wrap4}
 \end{cmhtcbraster}

 We note that, in \cref{lst:multiple-sentences9-mod1}, that the sentences have been
 wrapped, and so too have the comments because of the annotated line in
 \cref{lst:sentence-wrap4}.
 \end{example}
