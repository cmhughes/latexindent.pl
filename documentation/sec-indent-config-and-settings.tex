\section{indentconfig.yaml, local settings and the -y switch }\label{sec:indentconfig}
 The behaviour of \texttt{latexindent.pl} is controlled from the settings specified in any
 of the YAML files that you tell it to load. By default, \texttt{latexindent.pl} will only
 load \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml}, but there are a few ways that you can tell it to load
 your own settings files.

\subsection{indentconfig.yaml and .indentconfig.yaml}
	\texttt{latexindent.pl} will always check your home directory for
	\texttt{indentconfig.yaml}
	and \texttt{.indentconfig.yaml} (unless it is called with the \texttt{-d} switch), which
	is a plain text file you can create that contains the \emph{absolute} paths for any
	settings files that you wish \texttt{latexindent.pl} to load. There is no difference
	between \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} and \texttt{.indentconfig.yaml}, other than the fact
	that \texttt{.indentconfig.yaml} is a `hidden' file; thank you to
	\cite{jacobo-diaz-hidden-config} for providing this feature. In what follows, we will use
	\texttt{indentconfig.yaml}, but it is understood that this could equally represent
	\texttt{.indentconfig.yaml}. If you have both files in existence then
	\texttt{indentconfig.yaml} takes priority.

	For Mac and Linux users, their home directory is \texttt{~/username} while Windows (Vista
	onwards) is \lstinline!C:\Users\username!\footnote{If you're not sure where to put
		\texttt{indentconfig.yaml}, don't worry \texttt{latexindent.pl} will tell you in the log
		file exactly where to put it assuming it doesn't exist already.} \Cref{lst:indentconfig}
	shows a sample \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} file.

	\begin{yaml}{\texttt{indentconfig.yaml} (sample)}{lst:indentconfig}
# Paths to user settings for latexindent.pl
#
# Note that the settings will be read in the order you
# specify here- each successive settings file will overwrite
# the variables that you specify

paths:
- /home/cmhughes/Documents/yamlfiles/mysettings.yaml
- /home/cmhughes/folder/othersettings.yaml
- /some/other/folder/anynameyouwant.yaml
- C:\Users\chughes\Documents\mysettings.yaml
- C:\Users\chughes\Desktop\test spaces\more spaces.yaml
\end{yaml}

	Note that the \texttt{.yaml} files you specify in \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} will be
	loaded in the order in which you write them. Each file doesn't have to have every switch
	from \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml}; in fact, I recommend that you only keep the switches
	that you want to \emph{change} in these settings files.

	To get started with your own settings file, you might like to save a copy of
	\texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} in another directory and call it, for example,
	\texttt{mysettings.yaml}. Once you have added the path to \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} you
	can change the switches and add more code-block names to it as you see fit -- have a look
	at \cref{lst:mysettings} for an example that uses four tabs for the default indent, adds
	the \texttt{tabbing} environment/command to the list of environments that contains
	alignment delimiters; you might also like to refer to the many YAML files detailed
	throughout the rest of this documentation.
	\index{indentation!defaultIndent using YAML file}

	\begin{yaml}{\texttt{mysettings.yaml} (example)}{lst:mysettings}
# Default value of indentation
defaultIndent: "\t\t\t\t"

# environments that have tab delimiters, add more
# as needed
lookForAlignDelims:
    tabbing: 1
\end{yaml}

	You can make sure that your settings are loaded by checking \texttt{indent.log} for
	details -- if you have specified a path that \texttt{latexindent.pl} doesn't recognise
	then you'll get a warning, otherwise you'll get confirmation that \texttt{latexindent.pl}
	has read your settings file \footnote{Windows users may find that they have to end
		\texttt{.yaml} files with a blank line}.
	\index{warning!editing YAML files}

	\begin{warning}
		When editing \texttt{.yaml} files it is \emph{extremely} important to remember how
		sensitive they are to spaces. I highly recommend copying and pasting from
		\texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} when you create your first
		\texttt{whatevernameyoulike.yaml} file.

		If \texttt{latexindent.pl} can not read your \texttt{.yaml} file it will tell you so in
		\texttt{indent.log}.
	\end{warning}

	If you find that%
	\announce{2021-06-19}{encoding option for indentconfig.yaml} \texttt{latexindent.pl} does not read your YAML file, then it
	might be as a result of the default commandline encoding not being UTF-8; normally this
	will only occcur for Windows users. In this case, you might like to explore the
	\texttt{encoding} option for \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} as demonstrated in
	\cref{lst:indentconfig-encoding}.

	\cmhlistingsfromfile{demonstrations/encoding.yaml}[yaml-TCB]{The \texttt{encoding} option for \texttt{indentconfig.yaml}}{lst:indentconfig-encoding}

	Thank you to \cite{qiancy98} for this contribution; please see \vref{app:encoding} and
	details within \cite{encoding} for further information.

\subsection{localSettings.yaml and friends}\label{sec:localsettings}
	The \texttt{-l} switch tells \texttt{latexindent.pl} to look for
	\texttt{localSettings.yaml} and/or friends in the \emph{same directory} as
	\texttt{myfile.tex}. For%
	\announce{2021-03-14}*{-l
		switch: localSettings and friends} example, if you use the following command
	\index{switches!-l demonstration}
	\begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -l myfile.tex
\end{commandshell}
	then \texttt{latexindent.pl} will search for and then, assuming they exist, load each of
	the following files in the following order:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item localSettings.yaml
		\item latexindent.yaml
		\item .localSettings.yaml
		\item .latexindent.yaml
	\end{enumerate}
	These files will be assumed to be in the same directory as \texttt{myfile.tex}, or
	otherwise in the current working directory. You do not need to have all of the above
	files, usually just one will be sufficient. In what follows, whenever we refer to
	\texttt{localSettings.yaml} it is assumed that it can mean any of the four named options
	listed above.

	If you'd prefer to name your \texttt{localSettings.yaml} file something different, (say,
	\texttt{mysettings.yaml} as in \cref{lst:mysettings}) then you can call
	\texttt{latexindent.pl} using, for example,
	\begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -l=mysettings.yaml myfile.tex
\end{commandshell}

	Any settings file(s) specified using the \texttt{-l} switch will be read \emph{after}
	\texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} and, assuming they exist, any user setting files specified
	in \texttt{indentconfig.yaml}.

	Your settings file can contain any switches that you'd like to change; a sample is shown
	in \cref{lst:localSettings}, and you'll find plenty of further examples throughout this
	manual.
	\index{verbatim!verbatimEnvironments demonstration (-l switch)}

	\begin{yaml}{\texttt{localSettings.yaml} (example)}{lst:localSettings}
#  verbatim environments - environments specified
#  here will not be changed at all!
verbatimEnvironments:
    cmhenvironment: 0
    myenv: 1
\end{yaml}

	You can make sure that your settings file has been loaded by checking \texttt{indent.log}
	for details; if it can not be read then you receive a warning, otherwise you'll get
	confirmation that \texttt{latexindent.pl} has read your settings file.

\subsection{The -y|yaml switch}\label{sec:yamlswitch}
	You%
	\announce{2017-08-21}{demonstration of the -y switch}
	may use the \texttt{-y} switch to load your settings;  for example, if you wished to
	specify the settings from \cref{lst:localSettings} using the \texttt{-y} switch, then you
	could use the following command:
	\index{verbatim!verbatimEnvironments demonstration (-y switch)}
	\begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0;myenv:1" myfile.tex
\end{commandshell}
	Note the use of \texttt{;} to specify another field within \texttt{verbatimEnvironments}.
	This is shorthand, and equivalent, to using the following command:
	\index{switches!-y demonstration}
	\begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0,verbatimEnvironments:myenv:1" myfile.tex
\end{commandshell}
	You may, of course, specify settings using the \texttt{-y} switch as well as, for
	example, settings loaded using the \texttt{-l} switch; for example,
	\index{switches!-l demonstration}
	\index{switches!-y demonstration}
	\begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -l=mysettings.yaml -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0;myenv:1" myfile.tex
\end{commandshell}
	Any settings specified using the \texttt{-y} switch will be loaded \emph{after} any
	specified using \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} and the \texttt{-l} switch.

	If you wish to specify any regex-based settings using the \texttt{-y} switch,
	\index{regular expressions!using -y switch} it is important not to use quotes surrounding
	the regex; for example, with reference to the `one sentence per line' feature
	(\vref{sec:onesentenceperline}) and the listings within \vref{lst:sentencesEndWith}, the
	following settings give the option to have sentences end with a semicolon
	\index{switches!-y demonstration}
	\begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -m --yaml='modifyLineBreaks:oneSentencePerLine:sentencesEndWith:other:\;'
\end{commandshell}

\subsection{Settings load order}\label{sec:loadorder}
	\texttt{latexindent.pl} loads the settings files in the following order:
	\index{switches!-l in relation to other settings}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} is always loaded, and can not be renamed;
		\item \texttt{anyUserSettings.yaml} and any other arbitrarily-named files specified in
		      \texttt{indentconfig.yaml};
		\item \texttt{localSettings.yaml} but only if found in the same directory as
		      \texttt{myfile.tex}
		      and called with \texttt{-l} switch; this file can be renamed, provided that the call to
		      \texttt{latexindent.pl} is adjusted accordingly (see \cref{sec:localsettings}). You may
		      specify both relative and absolute%
		      \announce{2017-08-21}*{-l absolute paths} paths to other YAML files using the \texttt{-l}
		      switch, separating multiple files using commas;
		\item any settings%
		      \announce{2017-08-21}{-y switch load order}
		      specified in the \texttt{-y} switch.
	\end{enumerate}
	A visual representation of this is given in \cref{fig:loadorder}.

		\input{figure-schematic}
		\caption{Schematic of the load order described in \cref{sec:loadorder}; solid lines represent
			mandatory files, dotted lines represent optional files. \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} can
			contain as many files as you like. The files will be loaded in order; if you specify
			settings for the same field in more than one file, the most recent takes priority. }
