\paragraph{latexindent.pl}
latexindent.pl is a Perl script that indents .tex (and other) files according to an indentation
scheme that the user can modify to suit their taste. Environments, including those with alignment
delimiters (such as tabular), and commands, including those that can split braces and
brackets across lines, are usually handled correctly by the script. Options for verbatim-like environments
and commands, together with indentation after headings (such as chapter, section,
etc) are also available. The script also has the ability to modify line breaks, and to add comment
symbols and blank lines; furthermore, it permits string or regex-based substitutions. All user
options are customisable via the switches and the YAML interface.
