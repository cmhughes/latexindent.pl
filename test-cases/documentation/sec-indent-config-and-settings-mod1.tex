\section{\texttt{indentconfig.yaml}, local settings and the \texttt{-y} switch }
 \label{sec:indentconfig}
 The behaviour of \texttt{latexindent.pl} is controlled from the settings specified in any of the YAML files that you tell it to load.
 By default, \texttt{latexindent.pl} will only load \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml}, but there are a few ways that you can tell it to load your own settings files.

\subsection{\texttt{indentconfig.yaml} and \texttt{{.indentconfig.yaml}}}
	\texttt{latexindent.pl} will always check your home directory for \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} and  \texttt{.indentconfig.yaml} (unless it is called with the \texttt{-d} switch), which is a plain text file you can create that contains the \emph{absolute} paths for any settings files that you wish \texttt{latexindent.pl} to load.
	There is no difference between \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} and \texttt{.indentconfig.yaml}, other than the fact that \texttt{.indentconfig.yaml} is a `hidden' file; thank you to \cite{jacobo-diaz-hidden-config} for providing this feature.
	In what follows, we will use \texttt{indentconfig.yaml}, but it is understood that this could equally represent \texttt{.indentconfig.yaml}.
	If you have both files in existence then \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} takes priority.

	For Mac and Linux users, their home directory is \texttt{~/username} while Windows (Vista onwards) is \lstinline!C:\Users\username!\footnote{If you're not sure where to put \texttt{indentconfig.yaml}, don't worry \texttt{latexindent.pl} will tell you in the log file exactly where to put it assuming it doesn't exist already.
	}
	\Cref{lst:indentconfig} shows a sample \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} file.

	\begin{yaml}{\texttt{indentconfig.yaml} (sample)}{lst:indentconfig}
# Paths to user settings for latexindent.pl
#
# Note that the settings will be read in the order you
# specify here- each successive settings file will overwrite
# the variables that you specify

paths:
- /home/cmhughes/Documents/yamlfiles/mysettings.yaml
- /home/cmhughes/folder/othersettings.yaml
- /some/other/folder/anynameyouwant.yaml
- C:\Users\chughes\Documents\mysettings.yaml
- C:\Users\chughes\Desktop\test spaces\more spaces.yaml
\end{yaml}

	Note that the \texttt{.yaml} files you specify in \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} will be loaded in the order in which you write them.
	Each file doesn't have to have every switch from \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml}; in fact, I recommend that you only keep the switches that you want to \emph{change} in these settings files.

	To get started with your own settings file, you might like to save a copy of \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} in another directory and call it, for example, \texttt{mysettings.yaml}.
	Once you have added the path to \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} you can change the switches and add more code-block names to it as you see fit -- have a look at \cref{lst:mysettings} for an example that uses four tabs for the default indent, adds the \texttt{tabbing} environment/command to the list of environments that contains alignment delimiters; you might also like to refer to the many YAML files detailed throughout the rest of this documentation.

	\begin{yaml}{\texttt{mysettings.yaml} (example)}{lst:mysettings}
# Default value of indentation
defaultIndent: "\t\t\t\t"

# environments that have tab delimiters, add more
# as needed
lookForAlignDelims:
    tabbing: 1
\end{yaml}

	You can make sure that your settings are loaded by checking \texttt{indent.log} for details -- if you have specified a path that \texttt{latexindent.pl} doesn't recognize then you'll get a warning, otherwise you'll get confirmation that \texttt{latexindent.pl} has read your settings file \footnote{Windows users may find that they have to end \texttt{.yaml} files with a blank line}.

	\begin{warning}
		When editing \texttt{.yaml} files it is \emph{extremely} important to remember how sensitive they are to spaces.
		I highly recommend copying and pasting from \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} when you create your first \texttt{whatevernameyoulike.yaml} file.

		If \texttt{latexindent.pl} can not read your \texttt{.yaml} file it will tell you so in \texttt{indent.log}.
	\end{warning}

\subsection{\texttt{localSettings.yaml}}
	\label{sec:localsettings}
	The \texttt{-l} switch tells \texttt{latexindent.pl} to look for \texttt{localSettings.yaml} in the \emph{same directory} as \texttt{myfile.tex}.
	For example, if you use the following command \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -l myfile.tex
\end{commandshell} then \texttt{latexindent.pl} will (assuming it exists) load \texttt{localSettings.yaml} from the same directory as \texttt{myfile.tex}.

	If you'd prefer to name your \texttt{localSettings.yaml} file something different, (say, \texttt{mysettings.yaml} as in \cref{lst:mysettings}) then you can call \texttt{latexindent.pl} using, for example, \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -l=mysettings.yaml myfile.tex
\end{commandshell} 

	Any settings file(s) specified using the \texttt{-l} switch will be read \emph{after} \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} and, assuming they exist, any user setting files specified in \texttt{indentconfig.yaml}.

	Your settings file can contain any switches that you'd like to change; a sample is shown in \cref{lst:localSettings}, and you'll find plenty of further examples throughout this manual.

	\begin{yaml}{\texttt{localSettings.yaml} (example)}{lst:localSettings}
#  verbatim environments - environments specified
#  here will not be changed at all!
verbatimEnvironments:
    cmhenvironment: 0
    myenv: 1
\end{yaml}

	You can make sure that your settings file has been loaded by checking \texttt{indent.log} for details; if it can not be read then you receive a warning, otherwise you'll get confirmation that \texttt{latexindent.pl} has read your settings file.

\subsection{The \texttt{-y|yaml} switch}
	\label{sec:yamlswitch}
	You%
	\announce{2017-08-21}{demonstration of the -y switch} may use the \texttt{-y} switch to load your settings;  for example, if you wished to specify the settings from \cref{lst:localSettings} using the \texttt{-y} switch, then you could use the following command: \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0;myenv:1" myfile.tex
    \end{commandshell} Note the use of \texttt{;} to specify another field within \texttt{verbatimEnvironments}.
	%
	This is shorthand, and equivalent, to using the following command: \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0,verbatimEnvironments:myenv:1" myfile.tex
    \end{commandshell} You may, of course, specify settings using the \texttt{-y} switch as well as, for example, settings loaded using the \texttt{-l} switch; for example, \begin{commandshell}
latexindent.pl -l=mysettings.yaml -y="verbatimEnvironments:cmhenvironment:0;myenv:1" myfile.tex
    \end{commandshell} Any settings specified using the \texttt{-y} switch will be loaded \emph{after} any specified using \texttt{indentconfig.yaml} and the \texttt{-l} switch.

\subsection{Settings load order}
	\label{sec:loadorder}
	\texttt{latexindent.pl} loads the settings files in the following order:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \texttt{defaultSettings.yaml} is always loaded, and can not be renamed;
		\item \texttt{anyUserSettings.yaml} and any other arbitrarily-named files specified in \texttt{indentconfig.yaml};
		\item \texttt{localSettings.yaml} but only if found in the same directory as \texttt{myfile.tex} and called with \texttt{-l} switch; this file can be renamed, provided that the call to \texttt{latexindent.pl} is adjusted accordingly (see \cref{sec:localsettings}).
		      You may specify both relative and absolute%
		      \announce{2017-08-21}*{-l absolute paths} paths to other YAML files using the \texttt{-l} switch, separating multiple files using commas;
		\item any settings%
		      \announce{2017-08-21}{-y switch load order}  specified in the \texttt{-y} switch.
		      %%
	\end{enumerate}
	A visual representation of this is given in \cref{fig:loadorder}.
